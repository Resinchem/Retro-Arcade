### Cabinet Design Drawings and Dimensions

These are the hand-drawn diagrams and dimensions that I used in my build.  Note that some modifications were made during the actual build that are not reflected in these original drawings.  This is primarily the area around the control panel.  See the [Retro-Arcade blog series](https://retroarcadebuild.blogspot.com/), as the modifications made are all detailed within those articles.

I do not have CAD or other electronic versions of these files, as I worked solely off of these hand-drawn plans. Sorry!

The images are fairly large so that you can zoom in to see the details and dimensions.  Download the file(s) of interest for best results.
