This was my first (and only) attempt at building an 80's-style, coin-operated Retro Arcade.  The goal was to make it as similar as possible to an original arcade machine, while supporting the ability to play hundreds of different games on the same machine.  This determined not only the design, but the control panel configuration and more.  

As mentioned above, the actual build process is detailed in the following locations:
- YouTube Video Series - Multi-part series providing highlights of the build process
- [Retro Arcade Blog](https://retroarcadebuild.blogspot.com/) - Full, step-by-step 'diary-style' details of each step in the process.
